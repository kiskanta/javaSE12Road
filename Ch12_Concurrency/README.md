##Parallelism
Parallelism is conduction that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously
Parallelism is about doing lot of things at once.
also its Independent Ability
If one problem is solved by multiple processors.
  
##Concurrency
A condition that exists when at least two threads are making progress. 
Concurrency is about dealing with lot of things at once. 
If two or more problems are solved by a single processor

###Concurrency+Parallelism
Split the sequential flow into independent components
Use threads/threadpools to parallelize.
Whenever share resource is to be updated, use concurrency tools to manage state.
Whenever independent components (running on threads) need to coordinate, use concurrency tools
