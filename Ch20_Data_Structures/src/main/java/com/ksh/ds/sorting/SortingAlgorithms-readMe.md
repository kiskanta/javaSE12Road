Sorting Algorithm

Sorting Algorithm is to rearrange the records so that keys are ordered according to some well-defined ordering rule(ascending or descending).

Internal Sorting Algorithm
	Sorting all the data to sort is sorted in memory at all times while sorting is in progress.
External Sorting Algorithm
	Data is stored outside memory in small chunks. It is usually applied in cases when data can't fit into memory entirely.
